# The validator report is attached to the release as conformance evidence, so
# it has to actually be evidence.
#
# v0.1.0's first publish attached 130 bytes — two section headers and nothing
# else — because the validator writes its results to stderr and only stdout
# was captured. The job passed, the release notes claimed the report proved
# conformance, and the file proved nothing. This turns that into a failure.
