Digest-pinned, which is what a deployment should use:

\`\`\`yaml
image: ${REGISTRY}/${IMAGE_NAME}@${DIGEST}
\`\`\`

Verify it came from this workflow at this tag:

\`\`\`console
gh attestation verify oci://${REGISTRY}/${IMAGE_NAME}@${DIGEST} --repo ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}

Conformance of this exact image, from the official IIIF validators, is
attached as \`validator-report.txt\`.
