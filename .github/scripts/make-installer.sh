# Generate the `curl | sh` installer for this release and write it to
# dist/install.sh, with the version and every checksum baked in.
#
# Generated rather than committed because a static installer would have to
# resolve "latest" at run time, which means trusting whatever the API returns
# at that moment. Baking the version and the checksums in means the script a
# user pipes into their shell can only install the exact bytes this release
# published, and says so if it cannot.
#
# dist (cargo-dist) would normally own this. It cannot here: it would have to
# build the binaries itself to name them, and building *-linux-musl on a
# runner needs a C toolchain for mimalloc that harden-runner's disable-sudo
# forbids — see docs/release-engineering.md.
