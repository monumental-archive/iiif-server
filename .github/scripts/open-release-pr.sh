# Release phase 1, step 1b: put the prepared bump on a branch and keep exactly
# one Release PR open against it.
#
# The commit is created through GitHub's API rather than with `git commit`,
# because this repository requires signed commits and a runner has no signing
# key. A locally-made commit is `verified: false`, and the Release PR is then
# unmergeable — which is exactly how v0.1.0 first failed. Commits created via
# the API are signed by GitHub with its own key, and createCommitOnBranch
# writes every file in a single commit, which the REST contents endpoint
# cannot do.
#
# The branch is updated to the commit being released on every run, so the PR
# always shows the release that would happen if it were merged now rather than
# the one that would have happened when it was opened.
#
# It is updated in ONE move, from its old release commit straight to the new
# one, via a staging ref. The obvious two-step — reset the branch to main,
# then commit — leaves the branch momentarily identical to main, and GitHub
# closes a pull request whose diff is empty. That churned the Release PR
# number on every re-run and threw away its review thread (issue #53).

Merging this PR is the commitment point: it tags \`v${VERSION}\` and cuts a
draft GitHub release, which triggers the publish workflow to build, sign and
attach the container image and binaries.

Nothing is published until this is merged, and nothing outside this path
publishes at all.

- Version bumped to \`${VERSION}\` across the workspace and its internal
  dependency constraints
- \`CHANGELOG.md\` regenerated from the conventional commits since the last tag

Review the changelog as release notes: this text is what the GitHub release
will carry.
