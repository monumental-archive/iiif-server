# Design Spec — Modern IIIF Image Server

**Status:** DECIDED — scoping session 2026-07-26, amended the same day by a full
inline dependency evaluation (crate sources downloaded and inspected, official
spec/compliance documents and validator status re-verified). The only open items
are the two code-gated M0 spikes and the product name. **Naming:** the repo name
`iiif-server` is a deliberate placeholder. Product name, GitHub org, and domain
are deferred to the launch milestone (M8). The constraint this imposes:
**publish nothing to crates.io, Docker Hub, or any registry until named** —
registry names are forever.

economics: public repos get unlimited free Actions minutes including the free
arm64 runners our x86/ARM matrix wants; a later rename/transfer redirects
cleanly, unlike registries). **Public ≠ announced:** no candidate product names
in docs, issues, branches, or commits before M8; no announcement before M8.
**Audience:** a fresh session (or contributor) should be able to run tooling
standup and the build from this document alone.

## Mission

A complete, correct, boring implementation of the IIIF Image API — **3.0 level 2
and 2.1 level 2, each with the entire optional feature table** — as a single
static binary with a maintenance floor that is low, honest, and precisely
characterized. The engine delivers the spec, nothing more. **Zero C code parses
untrusted input, anywhere in the product.**

The structural bet, stated precisely: **the spec surface is frozen** — Image API
3.0 unchanged since 2020, 2.1 since 2016, image codecs are frozen file formats.
The dependency surface is *not* frozen and we do not pretend it is; instead it
is split into two classes (below) so that forced change is confined to a small,
named set. Therefore "finished" is a reachable state, not an aspiration — this
server can genuinely be *done* in a way almost no software can.

Contrast exhibit: Cantaloupe's 6.0 milestone — 36 issues of pure platform debt
(Spring Boot replatform, dead-dependency escapes like JAI, codec-interaction
bugs, four actual conformance fixes), delivering roughly nothing new to an end
user. The spec never moved; its foundations did. This project inverts those
choices so no such milestone can ever be needed.

## Conformance target — the complete build

**1.0 ships the entire IIIF Image API 3.0 compliance table: level 2 plus every
optional feature**, with exactly one asterisk (webp, below). Verified against
the spec and compliance documents as pulled 2026-07-26.

| Surface | 1.0 ships | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Region | `full`, `square`, `x,y,w,h`, `pct:x,y,w,h` | Complete |
| Size | `max`, `w,`, `,h`, `pct:n`, `w,h`, `!w,h` and **all `^` upscaling forms** | Upscaling supported ⇒ spec requires `maxWidth`/`maxArea` published — we always publish limits anyway (DoS posture) |
| Rotation | Arbitrary floating-point degrees + mirroring (`!n`) | Core milestones ship 90° steps + mirroring; arbitrary rotation lands in the completionist sweep (M6), pure computation, zero new deps |
| Quality | `default`, `color`, `gray`, `bitonal` | Complete |
| Output formats | `jpg`, `png` (core, the L2 requirement), then `tif`, `jp2`, `gif`, `pdf`, `webp` in M6 | tif: `tiff` crate already present · jp2: `j2k` encode path · gif: small pure-Rust crates · pdf: ~150-line hand-rolled single-image wrapper · **webp: lossless-only via `image-webp`** (encoder verified present in 0.2.4 source) — the single asterisk: valid `image/webp`, larger files, documented in one README sentence. No lossy webp because that requires C libwebp |
| Source formats | Pyramidal/tiled TIFF, JP2 + HTJ2K, plain JPEG, PNG | What real collections hold; working JP2 is the differentiator vs incumbents — and HTJ2K arrives free with `j2k`, a capability no OpenJPEG-based incumbent has. Full matrix in "Source-format matrix" below |
| HTTP (required at L2) | CORS + OPTIONS preflight · JSON-LD content negotiation for info.json (with `Vary`) · base-URI → info.json redirect | Conformance items, not polish — they belong to M1 |
| HTTP (optional) | HEAD · canonical `Link rel="canonical"` · profile `Link` header · float-formatting canonicalization rules | All cheap, all shipped |
| info.json | All required props · `tiles` and `sizes` **derived from the actual pyramid structure** · `maxWidth`/`maxHeight`/`maxArea` always published | Accurate tiles/sizes make viewers request only natively-cheap tiles — an underrated performance feature incumbents fumble |
| v2.1 endpoint | Full translation layer over the same engine — **all 18 named v2.1 features**, enumerated from the official compliance document: `regionByPx`, `regionByPct`, `regionSquare`, `sizeByW`, `sizeByH`, `sizeByPct`, `sizeByWh`, `sizeByConfinedWh`, `sizeByDistortedWh`, `sizeAboveFull`, `rotationBy90s`, `rotationArbitrary`, `mirroring`, `baseUriRedirect`, `canonicalLinkHeader`, `profileLinkHeader`, `cors`, `jsonldMediaType` | `full`↔`max` aliasing, profile-array info.json shape, `@id` vs `id`, `sizeAboveFull` mapped to the engine upscale path, `sizeByDistortedWh` (v2-only, dropped in v3) is non-aspect-preserving `w,h` — trivial for the resampler. Mounted at `/iiif/2/`, v3 at `/iiif/3/`. Both validator-locked |

**Why full-table is optimal, not maximalist:** every optional feature is either
pure math (rotation, `square`, `^` forms, bitonal, canonicalization) or
encode-only output (gif, pdf, webp-lossless, tif, jp2) — all in the pin-forever
dependency class. The forced-maintenance surface of the full-table build is
**identical** to a bare-L2 build; the decoders set the floor and we need those
anyway. Same cost, far stronger claim.

**Error semantics (spec-defined, engine-enforced):** 400 malformed/out-of-range
· 404 unknown identifier · 501 unsupported feature variant · 503 overload
(backpressure, with `Retry-After`) · 401/403 belong to the proxy layer, not the
engine.

**Capability is baked in, not toggled.** The binary supports exactly one honest
feature set; info.json is generated from that fact, identical for every image.
No feature knobs, no way for a deployment to misdeclare itself or fall out of
conformance. The only deployment-varying values are the numeric limits.

## Stack

- **Rust stable**, MSRV stated in README and enforced in CI (floor set by `j2k`,
  currently 1.96).
- **HTTP: `hyper` 1.x directly + `tokio`. No web framework.** Rationale: our
  routing *is* the IIIF grammar parser we build anyway (two endpoint families);
  CORS/HEAD/conditional-request handling are a few honest lines each; hyper and
  tokio carry real multi-year 1.x stability promises. (Note the corrected claim:
  hyper/tokio are the *only* 1.x-promised crates in the tree — avoiding axum
  removed one churn source, not the last one. The two-class doctrine below is
  what actually bounds churn.)
- **Pure-Rust image pipeline — no libvips, no glib tree, no system libraries, no
  C toolchain:**
  - Decode: `tiff` (pyramidal/tiled; delegates JPEG-in-TIFF to zune-jpeg),
    `zune-jpeg`, `png`, `j2k`
  - Encode: `jpeg-encoder`, `png`, `tiff`, `gif` (+ quantization), hand-rolled
    single-image PDF, `image-webp` (lossless)
  - Resample: `fast_image_resize` (SIMD)
  - ICC color: **`moxcms`** — DECIDED. Actively maintained,
    `forbid(unsafe_code)` when built without SIMD feature flags. `qcms`
    rejected: dormant on crates.io since early 2024, 103 raw unsafe sites.
- **JP2/HTJ2K: `j2k` — pure Rust, DECIDED as primary (source-verified
  2026-07-26).** The engine crate `j2k-native` is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`
  *including* its SIMD (via `fearless_simd`); MIT OR Apache-2.0; dep tree is
  `rayon`, `libm`, `log` + internal crates. Its API is the IIIF access pattern
  verbatim: tile decode, ROI decode, reduced-resolution decode, and
  `decode_region_scaled_into` — region-at-scale in one call. Decodes HTJ2K (Part
  15) as well as classic JP2.
  - **Risk register (eyes open):** young (0.7.x, single org `frames-sg`, low
    download count) · input model is `&[u8]` — mmap for local files;
    object-store JP2 means full-object fetch or a bounded source-chunk cache
    (recorded in Architecture) · internal rayon parallelism must be pinned to
    our worker-pool sizing via its `CpuDecodeParallelism` setting ·
    decomposition-level metadata for info.json `tiles`/`sizes` may need our own
    ~50-line SIZ/COD marker parse if not exposed.
  - **Fallback ladder:** all codecs sit behind a trait in `core`. Plan B is
    vendored-FFI OpenJPEG (battle-tested, upstream CVE tracking, costs a C
    toolchain and the zero-C headline) — a contained swap, verifiable against
    the differential goldens. The `openjp2` c2rust transpile is **dropped**:
    unsafe-riddled like the C it was translated from, but with CVE fixes lagging
    upstream — the worst of both paths.
- **Sources: `object_store`** (Apache Arrow project) — DECIDED, coverage over
  purity. Local filesystem + S3-compatible endpoints (custom endpoint URLs;
  Hetzner Object Storage is a day-one test case) + GCS + Azure behind one small
  trait. We consume a three-call surface (`get`, `get_range`, `head`), so its
  0.x breaking majors are mechanical renames absorbed at bump time; in exchange
  it owns the credential swamp (IMDS, IRSA, SAS, workload identity). A
  hand-rolled S3 client was evaluated and rejected.
- **TLS roots: `rustls` + bundled `webpki-roots`** — the only shape compatible
  with a `FROM scratch` image (no system root store). Root-store refreshes are
  routine Renovate items.
  > **CORRECTED 2026-08-01.** This is not what shipped, and the drift went
  > unnoticed until an SBOM was generated from the binary. `reqwest` 0.13
  > removed the bundled-roots option outright: every rustls path now resolves to
  > `rustls-platform-verifier`, i.e. the operating system trust store, which a
  > `FROM scratch` image does not have. The goal survives without dependency
  > surgery — the image carries the certificate bundle as a file with
  > `SSL_CERT_FILE` pointing at it, and is still `FROM scratch`. Worth noting
  > the failure shape this hid: serving local files works regardless, so only
  > `s3://` deployments would have broken.
- **Allocator:** musl's malloc is a known multithreaded-workload hazard and the
  M2 bench must not measure it by accident. M0 benches musl-native vs
  `mimalloc`; if contention shows, ship mimalloc — which is C, classified
  honestly as **trusted-compute C that never parses hostile bytes**. The precise
  headline either way: *zero C parsing untrusted input.*
- **Observability:** `tracing` structured logs · `/healthz` · minimal
  hand-rolled Prometheus text `/metrics` (fixed set: request counts, latency
  histogram, worker-queue depth, 503 count; zero new deps, frozen surface).
  Decided now because scope-freeze makes it permanent either way.
- **Workspace:** `core` (pure library: grammar, pipeline, info.json, codec trait
  — the grammar layer does no I/O), `server` (binary), `sources` (object_store
  wrapper + identifier resolution). **`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` workspace-wide**
  — the JP2 boundary crate from the original plan is deleted; it existed to
  contain unsafe, and there is none left to contain. **Licensed AGPL-3.0-only**
  (decided 2026-07-26); external contributions require a CLA, which ships with
  the repo at M0. All dependencies are permissively licensed (MIT/Apache/BSD),
  verified by `cargo-deny`.

### Dependency doctrine — the two classes

A dependency forces work only if it **(a)** parses hostile or semi-trusted bytes
(security advisories, forever) or **(b)** churns underneath us (0.x breaking
majors, absorbed at bump time). Sorting the tree by that metric:

| Class | Members | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tracked** (security watch, forever) | `hyper`, `tokio`, `rustls`+`webpki-roots`, `object_store`, `tiff`, `zune-jpeg`, `png`, `j2k`, `moxcms` | Renovate + advisory response within the MAINTENANCE.md window. Nine crates, all pure Rust — memory safety demotes decoder advisories from RCE-class to mostly DoS-class |
| **Pin-forever** (no hostile bytes, pure compute) | `fast_image_resize`, `jpeg-encoder`, `gif`, `image-webp`, PDF writer, all geometry/rotation/canonicalization math | Pinned at known-good versions; never forced to update. `fast_image_resize` being at major v6 is irrelevant — nobody sends an attack payload through a resampler |

Honesty note, on the record: apart from hyper/tokio, the tracked class is 0.x
(versions as inspected 2026-07-26: tiff 0.11.3, zune-jpeg 0.5.15, png 0.18.1,
j2k 0.7.5, moxcms 0.9.0, object_store 0.14.1). The committed lockfile makes
churn opt-in; the steady state is a handful of interventions a year, mostly
auto-merged. That — not "zero maintenance" — is the claim, and it survives
audit.

## Architecture

- **Stateless; no derivative cache.** Correct `ETag` / `Cache-Control` /
  conditional-request semantics; derivatives immutable. Derivative caching is
  the CDN/reverse-proxy's job. (Cantaloupe's derivative-cache machinery is a
  pre-CDN artifact.)
  - **One precise carve-out, decided now so it can't be lawyered later:** a
    **bounded in-memory source-metadata cache** (TIFF headers/IFDs/tile indexes,
    JP2 headers, optionally bounded JP2 source chunks). This is not derivative
    caching: the CDN can never cache source range-reads, and without this cache
    every tile request re-pays several sequential object-store round trips
    before the first pixel moves. Bounded, in-memory, evicting — no disk, no
    invalidation protocol.
- **The source-read seam is a founding interface, not an M4 discovery:** `core`
  defines an async byte-range trait (`read_range`/`length`) from M0. Decoders
  are sync and bridge at the boundary; local files satisfy it via mmap/read,
  `object_store` via ranged GETs with coalescing. This exists precisely so M4 is
  "add a backend," not "rework core I/O."
- **No TLS in-process.** Terminate at the proxy/CDN; documented deployment
  recipe.
- **No auth in the engine.** Access control = reverse proxy (`auth_request` /
  forward-auth pattern), documented as a recipe. Seam exists; revisit post-1.0
  only if reality demands.
- **Bounded blocking-worker pool** for decode/resample with explicit queue
  depth; overflow → 503 + `Retry-After`. Pool size and queue depth are the two
  tuning knobs of the DoS posture, alongside always-published
  `maxWidth`/`maxHeight`/`maxArea` and per-decode allocation/pixel-count
  ceilings (decompression-bomb guards). `j2k`'s internal rayon pool is pinned to
  this sizing.
- **Threat model, explicit:** source masters are operator-curated (semi-trusted;
  a malicious master is an availability problem, not RCE, because every decoder
  is memory-safe Rust) · request URLs are hostile (fuzzed grammar + identifier
  resolution) · resource exhaustion is the primary live threat (limits +
  backpressure above). This is why zero-C-parsing-untrusted-input is a security
  property, not an aesthetic.
- **Identifier resolution is a named security component:** exactly one
  percent-decode pass (spec rules: encoded slashes and `/ ? # [ ] @ %`), no
  re-decode, canonical-path traversal rejection. Directly fuzzed.
- **Near-zero config:** `<binary> serve ./images` or `<binary> serve
  s3://bucket/prefix --endpoint https://…` just works; env-var overrides. The
  source layer takes a **prefix→root map whose default size is one** — so if
  multi-root reality arrives, the answer is documentation, not architecture
  (pre-decided to defuse the most likely config-growth pressure). Anti-pattern
  on record: Cantaloupe's ~200-key properties file.
- **ETag definition (M5):** hash of (source identity + source version [store
  ETag or mtime+size], canonical request URI, binary version). Cheap, correct,
  no state.
- **`<binary> check` subcommand:** offline master inspection — warns "this TIFF
  isn't tiled/pyramidal and will serve slowly," flags old-style JPEG-in-TIFF
  (tag 6 — cleanly unsupported by the decoder, pre-1995 format), prints the
  one-line conversion fix; can advise HTJ2K transcode for faster JP2 serving.
  Converts the incumbent's #1 support burden into setup-time advice. Operator
  tooling, not spec surface.

## Source-format matrix (M2 acceptance criteria)

"Complete" implementations die by unstated pixel-format edge cases, so the
matrix is stated and closed:

**Supported:** tiled/pyramidal TIFF — none/deflate/LZW/ModernJPEG(tag 7)
compression, shared `JPEGTables` (verified in tiff 0.11.3 source; JPEG path
delegates to the zune-jpeg we ship anyway — zero added deps), 8/16-bit, chunky +
planar, YCbCr incl. subsampled · JP2 and HTJ2K via `j2k` (incl. native bit
depths, palette, subsampled components per its metadata API) · plain JPEG incl.
CMYK/YCCK (zune-jpeg) · PNG incl. palette, 16-bit, gray+alpha. BigTIFF: expected
supported, confirmed by M2 goldens.

**Rejected, cleanly, with `check`-time advice:** old-style JPEG-in-TIFF (tag 6)
· anything outside the matrix. A rejected master produces one actionable error
message, never a wrong image.

## Quality regime

- **Spec-derived property tests** on URL grammar and canonicalization (including
  float-formatting rules); parse↔print round-trips.
- **Golden-tile corpus** with perceptual hashing — codec/resample regressions
  cannot land silently. Test masters are synthesized by dev-only tooling
  (libvips/ImageMagick via mise) plus public-domain samples, fetched/verified by
  digest — **dev-time fixture generation is exempt from the zero-C doctrine,
  which governs the shipped product only.**
- **Differential JP2 testing — an advantage no incumbent has:** three
  independent implementations (`j2k`, `hayro-jpeg2000` as pure-Rust second
  opinion, OpenJPEG as golden reference) vote on the same corpus; disagreement
  is a test failure and a fuzz oracle.
- **Official IIIF validators** (v3 + v2) wired as a task and run in CI, **pinned
  from the `IIIF/image-validator` git repo** (active, last pushed 2025-10) — the
  PyPI package is stale (2019). **Validator output published as a release
  artifact** — conformance as verifiable fact, not README claim. The validator
  is the conformance *floor*: one leg of three (validator = spec conformance,
  goldens = pixel correctness, property tests = grammar correctness).
- **Fuzzing as the security posture:** `cargo-fuzz` targets for URL parser,
  identifier resolution, and every decoder boundary; local burn-in at M7;
  **OSS-Fuzz enrollment lands after M8** — it requires the public name (moved
  from M7; enrolling under a placeholder then renaming is churn in a third-party
  repo).
- **Supply chain (the monumental-archive gate discipline):** committed lockfile
  · `cargo-deny` (advisories + licenses) · digest-pinned CI images ·
  reproducible builds · SBOM per release · cosign-signed releases · `FROM
  scratch` image containing one static binary.
- **Benchmark honesty, with numbers:** M2 benches against a libvips reference on
  a stated corpus (pyramidal-TIFF and JP2 tile workloads) on fixed, documented
  hardware. Gate: **p50 ≤ 1.5× libvips, p99 ≤ 2×**. Miss → Plan B evaluation
  scoped to the failing codec only (vendored OpenJPEG for JP2, libvips wholesale
  only as last resort). The M0 allocator bench exists so this gate measures our
  pipeline, not musl's malloc.

## Maintenance policy — scope-freeze, stated loudly

At 1.0 the feature set is **complete by design and frozen**: security and
correctness fixes only, forever. This is the respected "finished software"
posture (TeX, qmail, the Go-1 compatibility promise, SQLite's 2050 pledge) —
uniquely legitimate here because the upstream spec is itself frozen.

Not claimed: literal code-freeze. A network server parsing untrusted bytes
always needs security response and dependency bumps. The honest residual is the
nine-crate tracked class above — advisories demoted by memory safety from
RCE-class to mostly DoS-class, handled as Renovate bumps with occasional 0.x API
absorption.

**Finished must not look abandoned.** Ship `MAINTENANCE.md` declaring:
feature-complete by design; security/correctness releases only; advisory
response within a stated window. The visible heartbeat — merged Renovate PRs,
signed patch releases, green scheduled CI — is what tells adoption committees
the stillness is intentional.

**Pre-refusals, written down now so future refusals are quotes, not debates**
(these go in MAINTENANCE.md verbatim):

- **AVIF / JPEG-XL output:** refused in advance. Spec-legal via `extraFormats`,
  and exactly how scope-frozen projects die. We ship the spec's enumerated
  table; modern-format transcoding is the CDN layer's business.
- **Auth in the engine:** refused. Forward-auth recipe covers it; the seam
  exists if reality overrules.
- **Presentation API, manifests, viewers:** refused. Layering (below).
- **`rights`/attribution in info.json:** refused. Per-image metadata requires
  per-image config, violating both zero-config and
  identical-info.json-for-every-image; rights statements belong to the
  Presentation manifest owned by the application. Documented rationale ships
  with the refusal.

## Milestones

- **M0 — skeleton + spikes + the seam.** Workspace (3 crates, workspace-wide
  `forbid(unsafe_code)`), CI (Linux x86/ARM on public-repo free runners incl.
  arm64), licensing (AGPL-3.0-only LICENSE file; individual CLA — Apache
  ICLA-derived text granting the maintainer relicensing rights — enforced on
  every external PR via the CLA-assistant GitHub app), tooling standup (mise,
  Task, Renovate, lefthook, cargo-deny — pattern-match the edtf and
  monumental-archive repos). Typed URL grammar, property-tested. **The async
  byte-range source trait defined in `core` from day one.** info.json for one
  local TIFF. One real tile decoded → resized → encoded. Official validator
  wired from git. Allocator bench (musl vs mimalloc). **Object-store
  mini-spike:** S3 range-read latency profile against Hetzner; metadata-cache
  sizing data. **SPIKE 1 (reduced scope — capability already confirmed from tiff
  0.11.3 source):** correctness/perf goldens for JPEG-in-TIFF pyramid tiles,
  esp. subsampled YCbCr. **SPIKE 2 (redefined):** `j2k` vs OpenJPEG goldens —
  byte-level correctness and the region-at-scale perf gate on multi-gigapixel
  pyramidal JP2s; verify decomposition-level metadata exposure (else write our
  ~50-line SIZ/COD parse); pin rayon to pool sizing. Failure → vendored-FFI
  OpenJPEG behind the codec trait (documented Plan B; cheap reversal at this
  stage only).
- **M1 — v3 level-2 conformance, one source format.** Full grammar, canonical
  URIs, CORS/conneg/base-redirect, error semantics. Validator green.
- **M2 — source-format matrix.** The full matrix above; ICC via moxcms; golden
  corpus + differential JP2 rig established; libvips bench against the stated
  gates.
- **M3 — v2.1 endpoint.** Translation layer; all 18 features; v2 validator
  green.
- **M4 — object_store sources.** S3-compatible custom endpoint (Hetzner) as a
  first-class test; GCS/Azure by construction; metadata cache tuned with M0
  spike data. (The seam already exists — this milestone adds backends, not
  architecture.)
- **M5 — HTTP caching correctness.** ETags (definition above), conditionals,
  immutability — headers, not machinery.
- **M6 — completionist sweep.** Arbitrary rotation;
  `tif`/`jp2`/`gif`/`pdf`/`webp-lossless` outputs — each landing with its
  goldens and fuzz targets. After M6 the entire compliance table is shipped.
- **M7 — hardening.** Local fuzz burn-in, limit tuning, load-tested
  backpressure.
- **M8 — naming + packaging + launch.** Name sweep and decision; org
  creation/transfer; static binaries; scratch image; trust bundle (SBOM,
  reproducible-build verification, cosign, validator artifact); docs and
  deployment recipes (proxy auth, CDN, TLS); **OSS-Fuzz enrollment under the
  real name**. First public announcement happens here and not before.

## Non-goals (permanent unless reality overrules)

Presentation API · viewers (embed Mirador/OpenSeadragon/UV; never build) ·
manifest generation · video or PDF *sources* (page extraction is the ingesting
application's job, done once at ingest — never live in the serving path) ·
embedded scripting of any kind · derivative caches · in-process TLS · auth logic
· lossy webp (would require C libwebp) · AVIF/JPEG-XL outputs (pre-refused
above) · per-image metadata in info.json · Image API v1 · feature toggles.

**Layer discipline reminder:** IIIF is a family. This engine is the Image API
box only — the pixel layer. Manifests (Presentation API) come from the
application that owns the objects; viewers are embedded JavaScript consuming
both. Deep-linking citations to pages/regions (canvas URIs, `#xywh`, Content
State) is manifest/application territory and works with any conformant image
server, including this one.

## Open items

1. **SPIKE 1 (M0):** JPEG-in-TIFF correctness/perf goldens (capability confirmed
   from source 2026-07-26).
2. **SPIKE 2 (M0):** `j2k` correctness + region-at-scale performance vs OpenJPEG
   goldens; levels-metadata check; rayon pinning. Plan B: vendored-FFI OpenJPEG
   behind the codec trait.
3. **Allocator bench (M0):** musl-native vs mimalloc under concurrent decode.
4. **Product name / org / domain** — parked until M8 by explicit decision. Until
   then: no *announcement*. Registry publication was unblocked for the image and
   binaries on 2026-08-01 (see the amendment at the top); crates.io publication
   is refused permanently, independent of naming.
