# Run the official IIIF validators against a container image.
#
# The point of the indirection: scripts/validate.sh normally builds a host
# binary and validates that. What ships is a musl static binary, built through
# cargo-auditable, inside a scratch image, with its own entrypoint and user —
# same source, different artifact. Publishing "33/33" should mean the bytes
# people pull, so the release pipeline runs the validators this way.
#
# usage: scripts/validate_image.sh [IMAGE_REF] [PORT]
