# Prove a built container image actually serves IIIF before it is published.
#
# Not a conformance check — scripts/validate.sh runs the official validators,
# and the release pipeline points those at the image too. This is the cheaper
# gate that runs per architecture: does the thing start, serve real pixels,
# report its version, answer its own healthcheck, and stop on SIGTERM without
# being killed. A published image that fails any of those is worse than no
# image at all.

# usage: scripts/smoke_image.sh [IMAGE_REF] [PORT]
